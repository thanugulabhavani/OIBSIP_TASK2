    <h2>A brief summary of Nethaji Subash Chandra Bose's journey</h2>
    <h3>Early life and education</h3>
    <p>
        Subhas Chandra Bose, lovingly known as Netaji, was an Indian nationalist leader who played a crucial role in India's struggle for independence against British rule. Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Orissa, he emerged as one of the most charismatic and daring leaders of his time. His unwavering determination, fierce patriotism, and revolutionary ideas continue to inspire people even today. Subhas Chandra Bose hailed from a prominent Bengali family and was deeply influenced by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda. He completed his education from the University of Calcutta and later went to study in the prestigious Fitzwilliam College at the University of Cambridge, England. During his stay in England, Bose became increasingly involved in India's independence movement and soon decided to dedicate his life to the cause.

    <h3>Leadership in Indian National Congress</h3>
    <p>
        Netaji's leadership skills and dedication to the freedom struggle quickly earned him recognition in the Indian National Congress. He became the President of the Congress in 1938 and 1939. However, his ideological differences with other Congress leaders, particularly Mahatma Gandhi, led him to resign from the position.

    <h3>Formation of Indian National Army (INA)</h3>
    <p>
        In the quest for India's liberation, Netaji sought support from various quarters and eventually formed the Indian National Army (INA) in 1942. The INA comprised Indian prisoners of war and civilians from Southeast Asia. He led the INA with the slogan "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom," which became an embodiment of his relentless spirit.

    <h3>Alliance with Axis Powers</h3>
    <p>
        During World War II, Bose aligned with the Axis powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan) to seek military assistance in the fight against British colonial rule. He established a provisional government in Singapore and urged INA soldiers to march towards India. The INA's actions and sacrifices stirred nationalist sentiments across the country.

    <h3>Mysterious Disappearance</h3>
    <p>
        In 1945, while traveling to Japan, Netaji's plane reportedly crashed in Taiwan (then Formosa). However, the details surrounding his disappearance remain shrouded in mystery and have sparked various conspiracy theories. His death, which was officially announced, has been a subject of debate and speculation for decades.
